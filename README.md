# Computer Vision HW1: Morlet Wavelets & Edge Detection
By Jason Yao

## Description
In this homework assignment, we are
given a "noisy" image in which we must
do the following:

	- Generate a gaussian-blurred resultant image
	- Generate the output image from multiple wavelets
	- Generate an edge-detected image

## Dependencies
- OpenCV 2
- Python 3
- [imgcat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gnachman/iTerm2/master/tests/imgcat) (optional, used to view the generated images in the terminal)
